**MAE4191**

Master thesis code

The analyses in R produced 2,720 lines of code and can be accessed through the R-file **4191_final_coding**. The OBD analyses were conducted in Excel and can be found here at GitHub under the name **OBD**. The main workflow is outlined below.

1.  Packages
2.  Load data
3.  Variable selection
4.  Missingness diagnostics
- Investigating missingness in scales
- Investigating missingness in items
- Visualization and statistical tests
8.  Multiple imputation
- Identify and select auxiliary variables
- Split dataset with one plausible value each
- Split dataset by country
- Run test imputation
  - Test imputation diagnostics
- Run full imputation
  - Full imputation restructuring
  - Full imputation diagnostics
9.  Multicollinearity diagnostics
10. Main analysis
- Create survey design
- Regression analysis
- Model comparison
- Calculate R2
11. Linear model assumptions
- Normality assumption
- Homoscedasticity assumption
- Linearity assumption
12. Investigating outliers
- Before imputation
- After imputation
13. Statistics
- Mean and standard deviation
- Skewness and kurtosis
- Correlation
- Sample sizes
